        <h1>Fabonacci Series</h1>
        <h4>Fibonacci sequence Posted by: Margaret Rouse WhatIs.com<br> The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with a one or a zero,<br> followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number (called a Fibonacci number) is equal
            to the sum of the preceding two numbers.<br> If the Fibonacci sequence is denoted F (n),<br> where n is the first term in the sequence,<br> the following equation obtains for n = 0, where the first two terms are defined as 0 and 1 by convention</h4>
